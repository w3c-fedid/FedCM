### **Problems and Solutions from the Browser Perspective**

#### Mozilla Firefox Johann & Peter \[slides\] 

Peter:

We have some history here: Persona, federated identity system.
Inspiration to some of webid. Closed in 2016.
[<u>https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona\_AAR</u>](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Identity/Persona_AAR)

Browser - centric approach in Persona. Decentralized identity is a
challenge. Wasn’t simple enough. Forced some of UX onto websites; didn’t
go over well. These were lessons learned.

![screenshot](mozilla-screenshot-1.png)
Concerned about new tracking vectors. Decentralization, not privileging
live organizations that have pre-existing solutions. New idps should be
allowed to exist.

Contractual relationship should not be necessary.

Handing off to Johann.

Johann: The main thing we’ve been doing is protecting our users from
cross site tracking.

![screenshot](mozilla-screenshot-2.png)

Not currently happy with set of existing solutions; interested in
exploring long term solutions to cross site cookies, etc, getting rid of
heuristics. Storage Access API might be a temporary solution.

Peter: We have talked to many teams that have challenges with auth flow
with storage access api. Persona is dead. Interested in learning more
about use cases.

#### Microsoft Edge (Melanie,Erik) \[slides\]

Melanie PM on Edge team

Goal protecting user privacy on the web: did user interviews. The users
wanted more transparency & control over how their data is collected and
used. Value privacy & productivity.

Promise: protection, transparency, control, and respect; implement with
Tracker blocking, storage access API blocking/access choice, surfacing,
cookies storage to users

“Core use cases of the web” must just work to ensure the productivity

**vNextFederated Auth**

-   Protect against cross site tracking

-   IDP/RP enlightenment - directed identifiers interesting, but conflicts with some use cases; browser should help surface the risks and what’s happening

-   Let’s limit browser specific tracking

-   How can we keep innovation possible and not lock out new insights

-   Mitigate breakage of existing sites

Incubating IsLoggedIn with W3C Privacy CG

Contributed the Storage Access API to Chromium (but it’s not activated
in Chrome); curious about something like that for identity-specific
flows

Question: WIll ad customization through consented tracking of interests
be considered?

A: Not in webID, other groups are discussing.

Heather: Interesting thing to keep in mind.

Erik A: The current thinking is just to break passive tracking. Might be
something to revisit maybe.

#### Google Chrome \[[<u>slides</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xK1x7EGX2wG57Cup2sVkASdDDQeySRuKQ2if4bcVg0c/edit#slide=id.gd7e9c918c6_0_0)\]

Sam Goto: WebID and the Privacy Sandbox

Hopeful as there is a good amount of common goals in the browser
presentations.

Privacy sandbox to prevent 3rd party tracking, fingerprinting.

Recommends
[<u>https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model</u>](https://github.com/michaelkleber/privacy-model)

Want to see the web more private with more federation.

Federation designed on top of the primitives that also enable cross site
tracking: can’t distinguish between the two. Classification problem!

Social widgets, personalized buttons, session management break with
third party cookie changes; Bounce tracking just looks like SSO login!

RP tracking problem: what about the IdP passing on global identifiers
and the SP colluding to develop tracking across sites. IdP tracking: And
the IDP knows all the places you have authenticated too!

-- WebId? WebSign-in? Name is changing! --

Useful principles

-   Users first, developers 2nd, browser 3rd, purity 4th

-   Privacy by default

Classes of solution

-   Ask for permission - backwards compatible but ineffective to drive change

    -   Permission blindness -- so many prompts

-   Mediation - browsers take control of some parts by rendering as visible in browser

-   Delegation - an IdP running in the browsers, tokens in the browser

    -   Unbundle global identification into directed identification

    -   Unbundle issuing and presentation

        -   User agent given a token from IdP; user agent creates derived tokens to grant to RP such that correlation by RPs not possible

Timeline

Early 2020 - reached out to WICG & OIDF, developed 3 options, prototyping, - 2021 - TODAY

#### Apple Webkit - John Wilander

Apple is working in some of these standard groups too. Apple used a 24 hr limit for 3rd party cookies: if a user visited a first party website within 24 hours, the website's cookies would be passed on in cross-site situations.

Storage Access API has some popup consent for authN purposes.

IsLoggedIn proposal similar to WebId -- some way to distinguish authN flows

### BREAK

### Identity Provider use cases (20min each)

We were not able to address the Enterprise, Higher Ed, SAML usecases look like? Weren’t able to schedule not that this is not important. Many more conversations we need to be having.

#### Microsoft Identity - Hirsch Singhal \[slides\]

Hirsch owns OAuth - both consumer (Live, etc) & Enterprise (Azure)

300 domains Office, Azure, and Consumer (onedrive.live.com, xbox.com, etc)

Auth has three domains -- plus all the enterprise SAML domains

Cross domain important for cloud provider to customers.

Consumer privacy in direct conflict with enterprise requirements. Seamless “invisible” SSO is desired, minimizing UX churn between all the work applications is important.

Customers paying for reliability -- if Microsoft breaks RPs they owe money to customers. More prompts would be “breaking”.

Microsoft working on their own relying parties …

Silent token refresh, implicit flow, broken. Move to auth code flow. No need for cookies, use refresh tokens. -- this has some shortcomings.

Fixing 3rd party means

Azure needs to revoke on demand, refresh tokens can’t be, so now IdP having to track at all RPs so that Azure can let RPs know and revoke. Force reload of applications because of the refresh token needs.

Multi-frame apps - aka - Teams -- broken with third party tokens going away.

Independent iframes with applets and widgets can be used third party cookies to allow sharing the sign in. Note third party may be legal third party or just a different domain for the same first party.

Iframes talk to each other through a broker: parent frame gets tokens for child apps on their behalf. This may be broken as privacy and security enforcements occur: will demand users to experience more ux flows…

All auth flows are being upgraded in light of solar winds - -new browser standards will need to be able to deal with responding to security (via extensibility)

Need enterprise controls for parity for enterprise security

#### Facebook - Brad Hill

Started in 1994, 2005 for infocard at Microsoft, consulting, RSA in 2011…. More details …. PayPal & Fido Alliance … then security keys at Facebook. So comments not just Facebook. Strong security focus.

W3C constituency prioritization better visualized as an ecosystem, winning designs keep all the needs in balance. Needs for Relying Parties must be kept in mind or the Relying Parties will opt out of federated
identity. Business and IdPs demand security controls that may not be first in mind for users, but directly benefits the users. Values exchanges are indirect and may not be as obvious. Need business models that will support the parties to continue to operate.

Disintermediating IdPs and SPs -- look at multiple attempts in the past. Drivers Licenses are not the best example because threat models and regulation online are different than physical world. Stolen Drivers license has far less of an impact than online authentication.

Mission critical for employees to cross org boundaries, intranets; need to have regulation controls and threat controls to meet legal
requirements.

The threat statement for WebId omits all the threats of theft of credentials and a broad suite of threats IdPs and Sps spend time to defeat.

Apple enforcement of webkit and other auth points analyzed & criticized.

Browsers may be the user’s agent, but they are developed by other companies that have business and competitive interests.

> Rather, we ought to think of a multi-stakeholder system like federated

#### Google Sign-in - Vishnu K \[slides\]

Our goal has been due to a variety of challenges, poor identity
experiences exist. We want to solve them from user and dev standpoint.
Identity as a barrier. You have to sign up to check out, save state,
etc. Then once you do, protecting id is challenging.

Password reuse is common. Interactions sometimes abandoned by identity
issues.

Increasing complexity causing a difficulty in saving state. Like booking
an airfare without signing in, might disappear when you do. Dropping
cookies, etc, can lead to frustrating user experiences.

Main solution to solve these problems is (does not work with opt out).
Google sign in flow (see slide). User must provide consent.

Sign in is automatic. Many things affect federation ecosystem.

Heather: Anyone from apple to talk about Apple sign-in?

Tess: nope

### BREAK

### Wrap Up Day One 

#### Consider the questions for Day Two (scribe -- lee graber)

Heather -- Go through questions and clarify what we discuss for
tomorrow. What needs to be fleshed out

-   GPDR requires IDP … How will Idps do this with disconnected RPs --
 How are the different proposals considering GDPR requirements

    -   Sam Goto -- (answer) Identified 3 variations (not mutually exclusive) … permission vs mediation oriented will give access to name which should satisfy GDPR. Should give same answer as today. Delegation variation … don’t have answer yet

    -   Heather -- Not having all the answers makes it hard for updates

    -   Sam -- Agree with Brad’s remarks on permissionless. Expect to co-exist. Permission variation allows innovation and backwards compat. Slowly things bake towards mediation and eventually  maybe towards delegation. All solutions have pros/cons and nothing is perfect.

    -   Kai -- Not only required to log consent but also to which RP. Have to log each and every transfer and potentially revoke and notify RP to delete data on their end

    -   Heather -- Good point for being ready for tomorrow. Question as to whether 100% backwards compat is ‘true’

    -   Heather -- other questions on workflow should be handled as part of some of that discussion

    -   Sam -- not necessarily 100% backwards compat but permission variation is ‘safey hatch’. Cost is permission prompt and need to find ways to make permission prompt effective

-   Is it conceivable that browsers mediating/owning the identity flows is not actually the desired objective?

    -   Brian Campbell -- it appeared that this was a goal and was pushing back to ask if this is really desired or came from the browser vendors themselves. As an end user, would prefer the user agent be less “aware of me”. Prefer using web primitives. Wanted to expand conversation / pushback.

    -   Heather -- Seems like perhaps there were some underlying assumptions and wasn’t clear what they all were. One appears to be that browsers are in the middle and should be responsible for mediation

    -   Tim Cappali -- Not clear whose assumptions there are. Web community, Browser vendors, Google, … Confusion comes from who forms these assumptions

    -   Brian -- How these assumptions are manifested in different browsers makes it hard for people developing for the web when it is not “a platform”.

    -   Sam -- (hint) Yes … it is conceivable that there are other options to solve the problem. Open to hear alternative ways to solve problem (tracking on the web). We are all ears. Mediation is not a presupposition on the web.

-   User provisioning workflows should be covered under GDPR discussion

    -   Hrish -- understanding how SCIM operates when you can’t talk about the user is interesting.

-   (Heather) Focus is on privacy as a sole threat to the point of ignoring the other threats. Are we solving tracking at the expense of making other threat mitigations worse (per some of Brad’s comments)

-   Safari changes doesn’t mean it is all working (can just mean that people are told not to use Safari) -- no real discussion

-   Idp communication authorization attributes for end user access, how will authZ work when it is decoupled from AuthN

    -   Sam -- Thought some about separating AuthZ from AuthN. Permission prompt is an escape hatch. Mediation thinking of decoupling openID scope from other scopes

    -   Brad -- Facebook has experimented with limited success (separation). Users know what they are signing into and what it should need. Increase user success by putting interactions together where they all make sense. (not separating).

    -   George Fletcher -- AuthN & AuthZ all combinations are real use cases. Can have a simpe SAML assertion that just says I am a student but not who I am. Can also just have authN and then both together. Need to be really careful about thinking about separating them. Forcing them to be separate would be a really bad user experience

    -   Sam -- Separating is a choice of the IDP and RP.

    -   George -- Make sure we think about use case and user experience. We need to design and build to enable best user experience

-   ⅔ browsers presenting are also ad-tech interests and use tracking methods not included in the “readme”s. Is this a conflict?

    -   Sam -- very valid question to explore. Mental model - user agent has lots of information about where you have been, your inputs. From a threat model perspective, UA has had this privilege for while. Useful to unroll this question

-   Id tokens are signed by IDP and checked by RP. What happens when UA is “man in the middle”

    -   Sam -- this is referring to the delegation model. “Easy answer” -- there is a long form document on this that is far from ‘done’. It is ‘directionally correct’. Gets inspiration for Personas

-   Enterprise / workforce use case differs from other discussions. (captures both of Lee’s questions)

-   Unintentionally … come back to (Heather)

-   Meditation flow … can you explain technical details of browser blindness safeguards

    -   No comments

-   Email address is usually used to identify users, doesn’t that need Idp support to support multiple identities with different email addresses

    -   Kai Lehman -- User agent has different emails with different identities. Idp needs to support

    -   Sam -- Good question. Idp could provide proxying (apple sign in). Email provider could provide proxying. Or Browsers could run extensions that do email forwarding. There are more possibilities than just IDps

    -   Kai -- But Idp had to verify the emails and so can assure the RP. If end user can just set up any email address … the trust goes away

    -   Brad -- Facebook offered proxied email and abandoned it. Very hard and barrier to entry. You obtain bad reputation for …

-   (Heather) Including regulatory perspective question with GDPR as part of general ‘legal’ questions.

    -   George Fletcher -- how do you manage relationship so that IDP knows the user said yes. If it is handled by the browser, is the IDP know longer liable? Creates an interesting dynamic that might require lawyers

-   Is there any hope of consolidating where this work is happening

    -   Heather -- reached out to privacy CG, IDPro, OpenID foundation, higher ed, … so many groups. Don’t know that it can be consolidated. Too many nested implications. Would like central place to keep tabs. If I was queen of the universe, it would be hub and spoke so central knows where work is happening and what each group is focused on. There is enough expertise in
        > each area to have deep dives but need to come back to central
